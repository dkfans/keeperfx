#: "Dwarfton"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"You are the last prince of Dominus, trapped at Dwarfton. The city of hard-working folk is under siege, and it seems all but impossible to repel the invaders. In desperation, you perform a mystical ritual, found in the moldy tome spirited from your ancestors' library during your flight from evil. At the price of your humanity, it bestows great powers of omniscience upon you, and allows you to direct your subjects with superb ease."
msgstr ""
"你是多米努斯的最后一位王子，被困在矮人小镇。这座辛勤劳作的城市正被敌人围攻，似乎不可能击退入侵者。在绝望中，你施放了一个神秘的魔法，这个魔法是在你逃离邪恶的魔爪时，从祖先的图书馆中找到的一本发霉的小册子里发现的。它以牺牲你的人性为代价，赋予了你全知全能的强大力量，让你可以轻而易举地指挥你的臣民。"

#: "Dwarfton"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"First victory in the long while, exhilarating. Empowered by an ancient ritual, you managed to turn the tide against the forces of evil. Yet soon comes the despair, for what are you now if not a monster yourself? There and now, you make a vow, to never let go of your origin as the human prince of Dominus."
msgstr ""
"这是很久以来的第一次胜利，令人振奋。借助古老魔法的力量，你成功地力挽狂澜。然而，绝望的感觉很快就来了，你现在不是怪物又是什么？此时此刻，你立下誓言，永远不忘记自己作为多米努斯人类王子的身份。"

#: "Sparkleforest"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"For aoens, it was home to fairies and elves, mystical beings of goodness and ethereal beauty. Now the filthy orcs trudge the clearings, littered with hacked logs, and hunt the few survivors to roast them for fun. The kings Dominus has vowed to protect the Sparkleforest, and you now return to fulfill the obligation."
msgstr ""
"在很久很久以前，这里是仙女和妖精的家园，她们是善良和空灵美丽的神秘生灵。现在，肮脏的兽人在空地上跋涉，到处都是砍断的木头，他们猎杀少数幸存者，把他们烤来取乐。多米努斯的国王曾发誓要保护星火丛林，而你现在回来履行你的义务了。"

#: "Sparkleforest"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"Magic is a fickle thing. Just yesterday all the meadows of Sparkleforest were dead and stank of rotting caracasses, but since its protectors are now safe, the enchanted forest is reborn anew. Will similiar salvation await you in the end, you wonder?.."
msgstr ""
"魔法变幻无常。就在昨天，星火丛林的所有草地还是枯萎的，散发着腐烂的气味，但现在因为它的守护者们安全了，这座魔法森林又重新恢复了生机。你不禁好奇，最终等待着你的也会是类似的救赎吗？"

#: "Abbeystone"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Unsightly banners and filthy markings desecrate the battlements of Abbeystone. The mighty monastery has fallen, and the survivors have fled underground, to the reinforced cellars. Your arrival post-haste left most of your forces behind, the time is still of the essence... but can you save the living if you are dead yourself?"
msgstr ""
"不堪入目的旗帜和邪恶的印记亵渎了修道院的城墙。这座伟大的修道院已经沦陷，幸存者逃到了地下加固的地窖中。你匆忙赶来，而你的大部队还落在后面，因为时间紧迫......但如果你自己都保不住性命，还能拯救其他人吗？"

#: "Abbeystone"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"Halls of Abbeystone, are now a sight to behold. Peaceful gardens and shrines of the Pantokrator, restored by the hard-working fairies and dwarves, are marvelous. Hope spreads among the men, for what was nearly lost is regained once again. If only you were to rejoice alongside your subjects, it would be perfect."
msgstr ""
"修道院的大厅如今已成为一道风景线。安宁的花园和潘托克拉特神殿在仙女和矮人的辛勤修复下焕然一新，令人赞叹不已。希望在人们心中蔓延，因为失落的东西又重新得到了。如果你能和你的臣民一起欢庆，那就再好不过了。"

#: "Widerwilds"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Once loosely attached to the kingdom of Dominus, with its fall the barbarian clans went completely independent. Horrible monsters roam the wilderness, and by this day only a single clan still endures, united under single chieftain. He does not recognize your authority, and challenges you for daring to trespass through his lands."
msgstr ""
"野蛮人部落曾经藩属于多米努斯王国，但随着王国的衰落，他们已经独立自治了。可怕的怪物在荒野中游荡，时至今日，只有一个部落仍然存在，由一个酋长统领。他不承认你的权威，并向你挑战，如果你胆敢闯入他的领地。"

#: "Widerwilds"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"After the treacherous devil hiding under the guise of a barbarian chieftain is put down, your righteous anger simmers down. You shudder at the sick irony of brave warriors serving the whims of the vile monster, all unaware of its true nature. Now the wilderness is safe to travel at night."
msgstr ""
"在打败了伪装成野蛮人酋长的奸诈恶魔之后，你的愤懑逐渐平息。勇敢的英雄们为卑鄙的怪物们服务，却全然不知它的真实面目，这种病态的讽刺让你不寒而栗。现在，你可以安全去这片荒野旅游了。"

#: "Misty Bog"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Filthy streams, bloody fog, sinister darkness and putrid mist - even weather died in presence of the worst necromancer in Dominus. His vampires were the instrument of destruction which brought down the Knightly Order of Dominus, and he went on to reanimate their bones and bind their spirits for his own sick amusement. The dead should rest, and you'll grant them their peace."
msgstr ""
"肮脏的河流、血腥的浓雾、险恶的黑暗和腐臭的迷雾--在多米努斯王国最可怕的死灵法师面前，就连天气也会死气沉沉。他的吸血鬼是消灭了多米努斯骑士团的罪魁祸首，他还会继续复活死人的骸骨，束缚他们的灵魂，以满足自己病态的娱乐。死者安息吧，你会让他们安息的。"

#: "Misty Bog"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"Murky waters, milky fog, blurry shadows and humid air. While still unpleasant, the weather is no longer tainted with unholy presence, and the wind is blowing eastwards. As the last vampire is staked in the bog, you wish you could've smiled grimly."
msgstr ""
"浑浊的水、乳白色的雾、模糊的影子和潮湿的空气。虽然仍然令人不快，但这里的空气已不再掺杂邪恶的气息，风也向东吹来。当最后一个吸血鬼被钉死在沼泽地里时，你希望自己能露出满意的笑容。"

#: "Knights' Castle"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Ruins of your ancestral castle, abandoned by men and haunted by the ghosts. No monsters roam the land, as there are no villages to plunder anymore. As your subjects rebuild the worn battlements, you turn your attention to the dungeons where your sworn enemies made their foothold."
msgstr ""
"这里是你的祖先居住的城堡的废墟，现在已被遗弃，鬼魂萦绕。没有怪物在这片土地上游荡，因为再也没有村庄可供掠夺。当你的臣民重建破旧的城墙时，将你的注意力转移到这个地下城，你的死敌就盘踞在那里。"

#: "Knights' Castle"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"Its white walls once again stand proud in the dawn, the defenders standing tall on the battlements. The people rejoice, for their kingdom is back. All the same, you aren't satisfied by enacting your vengeance. In short order, you march out against Wickedridge."
msgstr ""
"白色的城墙再一次在黎明时分中巍然矗立，城堡守卫也屹立在城垛上。人民欢欣鼓舞，因为他们的王国又回来了。但你并不满足于这次复仇。很快，你们就向恶魔山脊进发了。"

#: "Hellspring"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Fiery smoke and magmatic demons, wild and chaotic flow of molten sulfur - such are the lower levels of the Wickedridge. Across the lava, you can see the den of evil brimming with activity, and their sight drives you into frenzy."
msgstr ""
"炽热的烟雾和岩浆中的恶魔，疯狂而混乱的熔岩--这里就是恶魔山脊的下游。穿过熔岩，你可以看到邪恶的巢穴里群魔乱舞，它们的目光让你陷入疯狂。"

#: "Hellspring"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"Exorcised of its inhabitants, the lava river is now serene and calm. You can't help but feel restless at the sight, for it means the evil is still lurking upwards the stream. There's no time to waste as you move onwards to Wickedridge."
msgstr ""
"岩浆里的怪物被除掉后，现在变得宁静祥和。看到这一幕，你不禁感到焦躁不安，因为这意味着邪恶仍潜伏在溪流的上游。没有时间可以浪费了，因为你还要继续前往恶魔山脊。"

#: "Verminfeast"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"Haunted vale. Nothing grows here, and only monstrous vermin lurk in this land, littered with bones and shrouded with sickly smog blowing from the Wickedridge. Running out of supplies, half your forces turn back, yet you still press onward without care."
msgstr ""
"真是个见鬼的地方。这里寸草不生，只有可怕的臭虫潜伏在这片土地上，到处都是白骨，笼罩着从恶魔山脊吹来的病态烟雾。你的粮食快要耗尽，你的部队有一半人已经撤退了，但你仍然义无反顾地向前推进。"

#: "Verminfeast"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"All is silent. With the vermin-master slain, the vale is frighteningly dull and monotone. One could say the living do not belong here."
msgstr ""
"一切都安静下来了。臭虫之王被杀掉后，这座山谷变得沉闷而单调，令人恐惧。可以说，正常人不适合待在这里。"

#: "Wickedridge"
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid ""
"The hall of darkness, the stronghold of sin, the fortress of evil. You have gone far in your quest for revenge, and there is no turning back. Doubts aside, you cast your will outwards, the long-pursued goal finally within reach."
msgstr ""
"黑暗的殿堂，罪恶的堡垒，邪恶的要塞。你的复仇之路已经走得很远，没有退路了。抛开疑虑，将你的意志投向远方，追寻已久的目标终于触手可及。"

#: "Wickedridge"
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid ""
"The light illuminates the light, as paragons of virtue and goodness celebrate their victory. But for you? It is hollow. No release from your torment forthcoming, you can only suffer from impotent rage, watching the world from your diamond prison, and wishing for death."
msgstr ""
"光明照耀着他人，美德和善良的人们庆祝着他们的胜利。但对你来说呢？它是空洞的。你的痛苦得不到解脱，你只能在无能为力的愤怒中煎熬，在你的钻石监狱中注视着这个世界，等待着死亡。"
