msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Ludim. A sickeningly cheerful town where even the most trivial of events is celebrated with great fanfare. The people here "
"are so happy and carefree that it's almost nauseating. They sing and dance and frolic in the streets, completely unaware of "
"the dangers that lurk just beyond their borders."
msgstr ""

#: landview:11
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid "The once-cheerful town has been reduced to a smoldering ruin. The streets are littered with the bodies of the dead, and the "
"survivors huddle in fear in whatever shelter they can find. The sound of weeping and wailing fills the air, "
"and the stench of death is overpowering."

msgid "Havoth Dir. A serene and idyllic land where the sun always shines and the people are always smiling. The inhabitants of "
"Havoth Dir are content and generous, sharing their wealth and resources with each other without complaint. The air is filled with "
"the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of laughter."

msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid "The once-beautiful Havoth Dir has been plunged into darkness and despair. The sun has been blocked out by thick clouds of "
"ash and smoke, and the people now cower in fear of the Vampires that roam the land. The once-lush gardens and fields have been "
"reduced to barren wastelands, and the screams of the tortured fill the air."

#: landview:31
msgctxt "Level summary"
msgid "The once-pleasant town has become a nightmare. The streets are filled with twisted and corrupted creatures, the buildings "
"are coated in black mold, and the park is now home to a massive mausoleum. The children and the rest of the townsfolk have been "

msgid "The once-mighty castle has been reduced to a pile of rubble and ruins. The treasures and secrets have been looted and "
"destroyed, and the surrounding lands have been ravaged by war and chaos. The people have been scattered and enslaved, their "

# Undead Campaign

#: landview:100
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Winterrage - In the cold and icy mountains that are in the center of the country, is located a big city filled with pesky heroes. A real battlefield awaits you, where the white snow should be soaked of red!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:101
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Deathmoore - This place has been overwhelmed, Keeper! There are bits and pieces everywhere! Some of our minions even had fun making some bloody snowmen using the remains of the corpses, using them afterwards for training purposes! Marvellous!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:110
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Rosefield Cathedral - This is a very holy place, which is not good for our undead armies. A lot of paladins and monks are visiting this place, filled with the disgusting smell of flowers. A real place to reduce to ashes!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:111
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Sundew Ruins - The roses have been trampled and have been replaced with sundews; the kind of flower that entraps and devours insects. It fits perfectly with the scene of the now-desecrated cathedral, I must say!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:120
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Arbor Heights - This is an ancient bastion of everlasting happiness, carved into a mountain... bleh. I highly suggest to reduce this pathetic fortress to rumbles by flattening it."
msgstr ""

#: landview:121
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "The Low Lands - Nobody survived here. All of the pesky guards were bludgeoned, decapitated and burned! And the fortress has been reduced to a pile of shattered stones. A great victory for us, Master!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:130
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Drachenfeld - Dragons with a fiery temper rule this realm, stomping and burning everyone foolish enough that stands in their way. It's time someone teaches these overgrown lizards a lesson in humility."
msgstr ""

#: landview:131
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Dragontooth Wasteland - The great dragons have been torn to bloody shreds. Currently, our minions are collecting what remains of them to collect bones and decorate your dungeon with it, how stylish!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:140
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Ashspire - Of all the places, the enemy make his stand inside a giant volcano with superior numbers and forces. Prepare to flush them all out, one way or another!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:141
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Burntflesh - This realm has been filled with lava. There's a nice smell of rotten meat everywhere like if the volcano itself became a huge barbecue for all the remaining corpses lying all around!... Now, only one land remains before the total domination. Let's go, Keeper!"
msgstr ""

#: landview:150
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Dawnterror - This is truly a forsaken land; you cannot see the sun from this place and the howling wind cuts to the bone, lovely. The only thing I nitpick about the realm is the presence of Keeper Bane, who still sits on a false throne while the realms around it burned down. Have your final vengeance here."
msgstr ""

#: landview:151
msgctxt "Level introduction"
msgid "Deathterror - Finally! Bane is no more! All the surroundings are now piled with tons of bones and skulls into a dark atmosphere of death. The air is filled with ghost's evil screams and skeletons' laughter. After that intense battle, you are now the Keeper that rules the world... and the throne is now yours. Congratulations, Master!"
