REM Briefing

REM ********************************************
REM The Hangdamiens' experiment was....... half-successful. Even with
REM Castle Hangdamien conquered, the undead researchers managed to set up their
REM continued research in a yet unknown location.
REM Before you proceed there however, you shall need the knowledge to build
REM a Scavenger Room, which will aid you in the battles to come.
REM The knowledge lies in the Chief Librarian (as he is known) of Happiclap
REM Dungeon, a vampire of great intellect. He is currently imprisoned in
REM the labrinth deep below Castle Hangdamien, awaiting torture to extract the
REM plans for the aforementioned Scavenger Room out of him. Rescue him.
REM To do this, you have one of the finest Imps from your Hangdamien Dungeon,
REM but beware, the hounds of hell will soon be on his scent, so posses him
REM and try not to kill him, or the price will be high. Be quick, as it's
REM over when the fat vampire sings.
