## Intro
KeeperFX (Dungeon Keeper Fan eXpansion) is an open-source project that aims to fix up, enhance and modernize 
the classic dungeon management game, [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper).
This project is dedicated to providing an improved and customizable gaming experience while staying true to the spirit of the original game.

KeeperFX is a standalone game but requires a copy of the original game files as proof of ownership.
These files can be automatically copied from your old CDs, or from a digital edition like the ones from EA or GOG.

Originally, KeeperFX started out as a decompilation project, where we took the original game executables and reversed them back into usable code. 
Currently the whole codebase of Dungeon Keeper is remade and all code has been rewritten.
