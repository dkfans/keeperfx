; Name is the creature identifier which should be used in level script.
; Note that this file name must match the name here.
Name = IMP
; Language-specific name of the creature, as index in translation strings file.
NameTextID = 259
; Base health a creature has at level 1. The minimum is 1, and the recommended maximum is 100000, though exceeding this is possible.
Health = 75
; When a creature health falls below requirement, the creature refuse work and go to sleep.
; In battle, it will priorize using the Heal spell when available.
; Also a computer player will pick the creature and place it in lair.
; This works for autonomous computer players and for assistance players.
; The value is scaled 0..255, where 0 means never heal and 255 means heal even if small fraction of health was lost.
; Should be larger than CriticalHealthPercentage in rules.cfg.
HealRequirement = 20
; When a creature health falls below threshold, it means he could use healing.
; If an idle creature has Heal spell available, it will try to use it when below the treshold.
; Creatures sleeping to heal up, will stop sleeping when they go above the treshold.
; The value is scaled 0..255, like HealRequirement. HealThreshold needs to be larger or equal than HealRequirement.

Armour = 5
; Dexterity influences the odds for successful attack. It is scaled 0..255.
; If it is higher than attacked creature defence, then odds are higher than 50%.

; Also, odds can never get higher than 88% or lower than 12%.
Dexterity = 60
; Wounded fear set to 101 will make creature escape from any combat other than protecting heart, or a combat with single creature of the same kind.
; This special value works the same way regardless of creature tendencies.
; Smaller value will make the creature escape if it has less than given percentage of health left.
; 0: never escape, 100: escape even if no health is lost.
FearWounded = 101
; Fear of stronger creatures - how many times the enemy has to be stronger in order for the creature to escape.
; Value of 100 will make the creature fear an enemy with same strength,
; 200 will make it fear enemies which are twice as strong, etc.
; It uses melee damage, calculated based on strength, luck and creature level.
; The proper range of this value is 100..30000 %. Allows 0 to disable it.
FearStronger = 800
; FearStronger values are based on Melee damage and Health, so spells and abilities are ignored.
; To compensate, units with good skills get a bonus factor. 
; Both fear and intimidation are multiplied by FearsomeFactor before they are used.
; A value of 100 leaves it unchanged, 200 will make it appear twice as strong, etc.
; The proper range of this value is 10..10000 %.
