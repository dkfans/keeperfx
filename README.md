## Intro

KeeperFX is an open-source project that aims to fix up, enhance and modernize the classic dungeon management game, [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper).
This project is dedicated to providing an improved and customizable gaming experience while staying true to the spirit of the original game.

KeeperFX is a standalone game but requires the original game files to install as proof of ownership. Download KeeperFX from the [official website](https://keeperfx.net). Dungeon Keeper files can be taken from your old CDs, or a digital edition from e.g. EA or GOG. Installation instructions and a FAQ can be found on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/dkfans/keeperfx/wiki).

Currently the whole codebase of Dungeon Keeper is remade and the DLL is no longer required.
