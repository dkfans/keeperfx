REM Briefing

REM ********************************************
REM It seems that the same batch of Keepers that took
REM Loveyheart has turned to Rabbitjoy, a small village
REM that, until recently, had an allied Keeper, Neubet,
REM dwelling in its caverns. Neubet it seems, was first
REM attacked by a rival Keeper, then raided by some
REM minor heroes which will probably still be around.
REM Supplies are still low, and you will have to take
REM over an old Library to the east in order to research
REM and make Imps. To aid you in this task is one of
REM your finest skeletel warriors. He's there in case
REM there's some trouble lurking.
REM Take this Keeper as you did the Loveyheart fool.
