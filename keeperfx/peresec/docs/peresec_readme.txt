PE/DLL Rebuilder of Export Section (PeRESec)
-------------------------------

This program rewrites export section in a DLL file,
using a .MAP file to get new exports.

It works with all DLL files which have PE header.

It may be used to make more/less exports in a .DLL
 file if its source code is not available. It can
 also be used to help changing EXE file into DLL.

warning:
 This program may damage your DLL file; make backup
  before using it! There's no guarantee it will work.

legal:
 Please note that license agreement of many commercial
  programs prohibits modification to the code.
 Check the product license agreement before using
  it on program for which you don't own copyrights.

usage:
    peresec [options] <filename>
where <filename> should be the input PE file, and [options] are:
    -v,--verbose             Verbose console output mode
    -o<file>,--output<file>  Output file name
    -n<text>,--modname<text> Module name for export table
    -m<file>,--map<file>     Input .MAP file name
    -f<file>,--def<file>     Output .DEF file name
    -p<text>,--prefix<text>  Function names prefix

input files:
    .DLL and .MAP files

output files:
    .DLL and .DEF files

The program clears previous export table in .DLL file
 and replaces it with new one, made using entries from
 .MAP file. If there's no export section in the file,
 then it is created, and its size is matched to the
 functions in .MAP file.

The .MAP file is generated by many compilers, but also
 some disassemblers can make it, for example IDA Pro.
Even if you don't have a program that generates it,
 it's relatively easy to write this file by hand.

Generated .DEF file may be needed to compile programs
 which uses the DLL. Not all compilers require .DEF
 file, but most of them do. If you won't specify a
 .DEF file name, then it will be assumed that it should
 have same file name as output file, but with .def
 extension.

example map file:
 The map file is a text file which defines one export
  table entry per line. Here is an example of one-line
  file (only one entry exported):
<CUT HERE>
 0001:000DBE80       WinMain@16
<CUT HERE>
 As you can see, the structure of every line is:
 seg:offset          function_name

Note that format of the function_name may be different
 for functions compiled with various calling conventions.
For example __stdcall comes in the format same as above:
 name@args. But __cdecl should be named without arguments.

example of use:
  peresec -v -o"keeperfx.dll" -p"_DK_" "keeper95_gold.dll"

This command will create "keeperfx.dll" and "keeperfx.def"
 from "keeper95_gold.dll" and "keeper95_gold.map".
All function names inside DLL will be preceded by "_DK_".
