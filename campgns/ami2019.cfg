; Details about levels will follow. Only sections mentioned in [common] block
; will be parsed by the game; other blocks are skipped.
; NAME_IDs are message IDs from strings file.
; Note that NAME_TEXTs are not used if NAME_IDs are present.

; is selected; it is usually the same place where ensign is, but may be moved
; a few pixels if this gives better graphics result.
; LAND_VIEW option should be only present in single player levels.
