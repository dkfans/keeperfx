 * @brief A date and time used for astronomical calculations.
 *
 * This type is of fundamental importance to Astronomy Engine.
 * It is used to represent dates and times for all astronomical calculations.
 * It is also included in the values returned by many Astronomy Engine functions.
 *
 * To create a valid astro_time_t value from scratch, call #Astronomy_MakeTime
 * (for a given calendar date and time) or #Astronomy_CurrentTime (for the system's
 * current date and time).
 *
 * To adjust an existing astro_time_t by a certain real number of days,
 * call #Astronomy_AddDays.
 *
 * The astro_time_t type contains `ut` to represent Universal Time (UT1/UTC) and
 * `tt` to represent Terrestrial Time (TT, also known as *ephemeris time*).
 * The difference `tt-ut` is known as *&Delta;T*, using a best-fit piecewise model devised by
 * [Espenak and Meeus](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/deltatpoly2004.html).
 *
 * Both `tt` and `ut` are necessary for performing different astronomical calculations.
 * Indeed, certain calculations (such as rise/set times) require both time scales.
 * See the documentation for the `ut` and `tt` fields for more detailed information.
 *
 * In cases where `astro_time_t` is included in a structure returned by
 * a function that can fail, the `astro_status_t` field `status` will contain a value
 * other than `ASTRO_SUCCESS`; in that case the `ut` and `tt` will hold `NAN` (not a number).
 * In general, when there is an error code stored in a struct field `status`, the
 * caller should ignore all other values in that structure, including the `ut` and `tt`
 * inside `astro_time_t`.

     * Astronomy Engine approximates UTC and UT1 as being the same thing, although they are
     * not exactly equivalent; UTC and UT1 can disagree by up to &plusmn;0.9 seconds.
     * This approximation is sufficient for the accuracy requirements of Astronomy Engine.
     *
     * Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) is the international standard for legal and civil
     * timekeeping and replaces the older Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) standard.
     * UTC is kept in sync with unpredictable observed changes in the Earth's rotation
     * by occasionally adding leap seconds as needed.
     *
     * UT1 is an idealized time scale based on observed rotation of the Earth, which
     * gradually slows down in an unpredictable way over time, due to tidal drag by the Moon and Sun,
     * large scale weather events like hurricanes, and internal seismic and convection effects.
     * Conceptually, UT1 drifts from atomic time continuously and erratically, whereas UTC
     * is adjusted by a scheduled whole number of leap seconds as needed.
     *
     * The value in `ut` is appropriate for any calculation involving the Earth's rotation,
     * such as calculating rise/set times, culumination, and anything involving apparent
     * sidereal time.
