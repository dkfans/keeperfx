; KeeperFX Mods/Modifications Order Configuration file version 1.0.

; This is a disabled exampe file called '_load_order.cfg'. Rename it to 'load_order.cfg' to make it active.
; Activating this file will activate the 2 demo mods: `tunneller_imp_swap` and `instant_charge_up`.
; Put a ; in front of a mod to disable it.

; Put new mods into a section below by adding their name/directory. Every mod on a different line.
; Mods loaded later will overwrite those loaded earlier. So, the later the configuration, the higher the priority.
; Do not configure in the after_campaign or after_map section, unless you have a clear understanding of the effects. Your mod could make a map unwinnable.
