; Where the power can be casted. Some map-related options are:

; REVEALED_TEMP - allow casting on temporarily-revealed tiles (ie. by sight of evil)
; CLAIMABLE - don't allow to cast on tiles which can't be claimed (ie. water, lava, rock)
; ALL_TALL - allow casting the spell on all tall terrain types (ie. wall, gold, rock)
; NEUTRL_TALL - allow casting the spell on tall terrain types owned by neutral player, including unowned
; OWNED_TALL - allow casting the spell on tall terrain types owned by casting player
; ALLIED_TALL - allow casting the spell on tall terrain types owned by allied players
; ENEMY_TALL - allow casting the spell on tall terrain types owned by enemy players
; ALL_GROUND - allow casting the spell on all ground-level terrain types (ie. path, water, lava, claimed ground)
; UNCLMD_GROUND - allow casting the spell on natural ground-level terrain types (path, water, lava)
; NEUTRL_GROUND - allow casting the spell on constructed ground-level terrain types owned by neutral player (claimed ground, rooms)
; OWNED_GROUND - allow casting the spell on constructed ground-level terrain types owned by casting player
; ALLIED_GROUND - allow casting the spell on constructed ground-level terrain types owned by allied players
; ENEMY_GROUND - allow casting the spell on constructed ground-level terrain types owned by enemy players
; ANYWHERE - allow casting the spell on any revealed area; this overrides all map-related options other than UNREVEALED and REVEALED_TEMP
; Besides map-related options, there are thing-related ones. If at least one thing-related
; option is present, then spell can only be casted if both map-related and thing-related conditions
; are met, unless an additional option is present:
; THING_OR_MAP - makes it that only one of map-related and thing-related condition groups has to be met
; Some of thing-related conditions are:
; CUSTODY_CRTRS - allow casting on creatures being held in custody
; OWNED_CRTRS - allow casting on players own creatures
; ALLIED_CRTRS - allow casting on creatures belonging to allied players
; ENEMY_CRTRS - allow casting on creatures owned by enemy players
; BOUND_CRTRS - allow casting on creatures being affected by Armageddon and Teleport; but also those
;     who are dragging, leaving or being sacrificed; allowing this may have bad side effects
