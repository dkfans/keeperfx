# KeeperFX Texture animation Configuration file
# these numbers get used for making cubes in cubes.cfg
# and for determining the floor texture in columns in columns.cfg and the .clm files bundled with maps
# the frames reference static textures 0-543 for textures in tmapaXXX.dat
# the animated numbers start at 544 and end at 999
# numbers starting at 1000 are in tmapbXXX.dat
