## Intro

KeeperFX is an open-source project that aims to enhance and modernize the classic dungeon management game, [Dungeon Keeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper).
This project is dedicated to providing an improved and customizable gaming experience while staying true to the spirit of the original game.

KeeperFX is a standalone game but requires the original game files to install. You can use your old CDs, or a digital edition that can be bought from EA or GOG.

Originally, KeeperFX started out as a decompilation project. The original Keeper.exe was converted to a DLL and KeeperFX used the original functions that weren't implemented yet.
Currently the whole codebase of Dungeon Keeper is remade and the DLL is no longer required.
