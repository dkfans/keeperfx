# Doxyfile 1.9.3

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Astronomy Engine"

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       = "The $name class" \

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# When the TOC_INCLUDE_HEADINGS tag is set to a non-zero value, all headings up
# to that level are automatically included in the table of contents, even if
# they do not have an id attribute.
# Note: This feature currently applies only to Markdown headings.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 99, default value: 5.
# This tag requires that the tag MARKDOWN_SUPPORT is set to YES.

# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# With the correct setting of option CASE_SENSE_NAMES doxygen will better be
# able to match the capabilities of the underlying filesystem. In case the
# filesystem is case sensitive (i.e. it supports files in the same directory
# whose names only differ in casing), the option must be set to YES to properly
# deal with such files in case they appear in the input. For filesystems that
# are not case sensitive the option should be be set to NO to properly deal with
# output files written for symbols that only differ in casing, such as for two
# classes, one named CLASS and the other named Class, and to also support
# references to files without having to specify the exact matching casing. On
# Windows (including Cygwin) and MacOS, users should typically set this option
# to NO, whereas on Linux or other Unix flavors it should typically be set to
# YES.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the todo
# list. This list is created by putting \todo commands in the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

# The GENERATE_TESTLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the test

# The GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO)
# the deprecated list. This list is created by putting \deprecated commands in
# the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST= NO

# If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to YES then doxygen will immediately stop when
# a warning is encountered. If the WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to FAIL_ON_WARNINGS
# then doxygen will continue running as if WARN_AS_ERROR tag is set to NO, but
# at the end of the doxygen process doxygen will return with a non-zero status.
# Possible values are: NO, YES and FAIL_ON_WARNINGS.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_AS_ERROR          = YES

# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

                         astronomy.c

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see:
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

# Configuration options related to the RTF output

# readers/editors.
# The default value is: NO.

# Configuration options related to the XML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

# The XML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the XML pages will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: xml.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_OUTPUT             = xml

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_AUTOGEN_DEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an
