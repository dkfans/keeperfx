REM Briefing

REM ********************************************
REM Happiclap, with foundations so strong, the villages
REM say that friendship and compassion between them will
REM always be strong. Unfortunatly, this also makes it
REM almost impossible to build a dungeon here. Pity.
REM Though the undergrounds of Happiclap are used to
REM carry traps and food from Bunnyjoy to the Sillimist Dungeons.
REM The labrinth has been overthrown by these rouge Keepers
REM and they have killed all the guides, leaving a terrible
REM prediciment: Your troops are stranded. Guide them out
REM of the maze so you can continue with the slaughter of the rouge Keepers.
