REM
REM Script for Level 211
REM
REM This level contains prison just next to enemy
REM wall - it will teach the player what jailbreak is.
REM It also allows to imprison skeletons - as they
REM have no hunger, it's not easy to starve them.
REM Besides that - you've got 2 Bile Demons and
REM an Avatar, and have to capture heroes to make your
REM army. The enemy keeper has a better start and is
REM behind a river, so he won't attack easily.
