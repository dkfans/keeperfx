; KeeperFX Magic Configuration file version 1.0.

; [spell]
; Spells are casted by creatures at their position. They can affect the caster or surrounding things.
; They can also generate a shot, which can reach a more distant target.

; [shot]
; Shots are generated by spells to move the place of effect.
; They can be directed towards a thing and even navigated, or just released at some angle in the dungeon with no particular target.

; [power]
; Powers are spells which have several levels of strengths and can be casted not only by a creature, but also by a keeper.

; [special]
; Specials are rare boxes a player can find, which provide reward of one time use.

; Spells types.
