; KeeperFX Creature Model Configuration file

; NOTES FROM THE FIREFLY DAD : This mod had be made to initiate the elites variants for all the evil creatures and bosses for the good ones. Just a work to inspire better creators for the other. But for now our lighting bug is alone and call it "elite_something" doesn't make sense for now.
; Add the compressed folder into the "fxdata" folder without extraction; just remane it to "elite_fly" later.
; Add the creature's name in the creature.cfg's creature list, let almost 20 empty entries after for further evil elites. (and the same for bosses).
; So "firefly" is a temporary name, in the future, all the "firefly" iterations must be replaced by "elite_fly" in this file + in the creature.cfg's creature list + in the name of the compressed folder + in object.cfg for the lair + in rules.cfg if sacrifice recipe + in fly.cfg if growup + in the "gtext.dat" files if used... Any left?
; I'm so pride of the little fireflies dancing around the ardent nest, don't forget to add an entry for the lair in "object.cfg" : (use line space instead of //) [objectXXX] Name = LAIR_FIREFLY // Genre = LAIR_TOTEM // AnimationID = FIREFLY_LAIR // AnimationSpeed = 12 // Size_XY = 0 // Size_Z = 0 // MaximumSize = 300 //DestroyOnLava = 0 // DestroyOnLiquid = 0 // RelatedCreature = FIREFLY // Health = 0 // FallAcceleration = 0 // LightUnaffected = 0 // LightIntensity = 0 // LightRadius = 0 // LightIsDynamic = 0 // DrawClass = 2 // Persistence = 2 // Immobile = 0 // Properties = EXISTS_ONLY_IN_ROOM DESTROYED_ON_ROOM_CLAIM DESTROYED_ON_ROOM_PLACE // UpdateFunction = UPDATE_OBJECT_SCALE
; Note that different icons and portraits are available, one for the firefly that fit with the colors, and one with a golden medal according to the elite statut of the creature. The icon.json and stripes.json files will switch themself.
; Moreover, the following caracteristics are thought more as a fly improvement on everything with fire affinities, scout abilities and some "elite" specificities than a properly new creature. I worked a lot on the animation, not really in testing the strenght of the unit on a map so feel free to rebalance that as you wish or need, try, taste and make a feedback on it.
; Some variables available in this file type but almost never used by the original games aren't been used here cause I did not dare without a good test and understanding of them, but i think that making elites is the perfect pretext to have fun with it. So my balance may be boring, do it better and purpose!
; To get a fully available creature without adding it in every map scripts to get it by portal, two ways may be used: firstly, adding a sacrifice recipe in "rules.cfg", something like " MkCreature =  FIREFLY           FLY FLY FLY KNIGHT " or/+ open the vanilla fly.cfg and add to the experience ยง "GrowUp=50000 FIREFLY 3"
