 * Collection process:
 * 1. Block header (if any) is reserved in new state buffer.
 * 2. Block body of len bytes are reserved in new state buffer. (Conceptually.)
 * 3. If ptr != NULL, len bytes a copied to block body from ptr.
 * 4. If on_collect != NULL, call on_collect with destptr = block body.
 *  This allows special case code that handles e.g. pointers. It can also allow
 *  complete customization of resultant data if ptr == NULL.
 * 5. Perform specified delta encoding on block body. If DELTA_SELECTBEST, try
 *  different (select the one with least self information content).
 * 6. Update block header (if any).
 * 7. Instruction has finished.
 *
 * Restoration is essentially the reverse. The meaning of destptr in on_restore
 * is ptr (swapped).
