REM Briefing

REM ********************************************
REM Sadlack is in ruins, the dungeons beneath crushed, the King hanged, the castle burned to the
REM ground, it's lovely.
REM But, the chief wizard at Sadlack visited the chieftain of Hangdamien, an island west of Sadlack
REM shortly before our attack on the wretched Castle Sadlack,
REM to display his ideas of luring demons directly from Portals to join their ranks, allowing them to set
REM up Hearts of their own and destroy pesky Keepers. So, while the original plans
REM and the wizards that spired them burnt in Sadlack, the ideas still lived in Hangdamien's wizard's minds and
REM now, angered by you taking Sadlack, have now began researching the matter.
REM There are four Libraries in Hopemirth for you to destroy. Start by taking over the abandoned dungeon
REM and research the Destroy Walls spell. We have heard from the babbles of those foolhardy heroes on our
REM torture tables from Sadlack that these Hangdamiens also enlisted in the help of
REM some of the Sadlack researchers. Whatever that means.
REM One final word, we have put forth a hound called Rover to aid you. Take care of him, he's a good boy.
